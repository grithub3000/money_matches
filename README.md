My friends and I like to play Super Smash Bros with money on the line. When we do this, we will usually play dozens of sets, usually worth $5 each. Because everyone's money amount is changing so much, we usually don't pay out until the end of the night, so we don't have to be passing money around all night. This can make it hard to keep track of how much money everyone is owed/owes after playing for a couple of hours. This app allows that to be easily kept track of, simply by clicking a couple of buttons after each set to update the players' money amounts.
